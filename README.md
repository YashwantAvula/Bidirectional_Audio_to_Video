#  Audio To Visual: Reversible Audio-Visualizer using STFT and OpenL3

**Audio2Visual** is a Python-based pipeline that converts full-length audio into high-fidelity visual representations (video frames or embeddings), with full support for **reconstructing the original audio** from the visuals. It also supports **semantic visualizations** using OpenL3 embeddings for creative or analytical purposes.

## Features

- Convert audio into video using **STFT-based spectrograms**
-  Reconstruct original audio from **magnitude + phase video**
-  Generate **enhanced visuals** with custom color encoding
-  Visualize **OpenL3 embeddings** with t-SNE maps
-  Sync visuals with time progression through the song
-  Build-ready for generative audio/visual systems
